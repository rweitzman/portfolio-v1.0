A portfolio for Robin.

## For Robin:
(Could you please make a readme.md that has the location of files/lines in the code base that contain the colors, descriptions, images, and resume stuff in case I decide to change that stuff in the future?):
* Colors can be found at the top of the main.css file in the public directory.
* All the images are located in the public/img directory.
* Your resume should be stored in the public directory. You may need to adjust the href in the footer to get the download link to work.
* All html is in the index.ejs file in the views directory. It should be fairly obvious what images, descriptions and links are what, but ask me if you need any clarification.
* The animation for the header profile is in the main.css file under the .profile and .profile.down selectors.

Use lighter EDDCD2, FFF1E6 AND FOEFEB for bulk of it, the other four as accent colors. Please use my picture on linked in for my pic, it is awful, so I need to get a new one.- old
